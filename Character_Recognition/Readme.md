# Character Recognition
## Downloading and caching Dataset
Download character recognition Dataset from this [link](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/EnglishHnd.tgz).
Create 'Dataset/' folder storing the dataset.
The Flattened images of the above Dataset and their classifications are cached in flattened_images_english.txt and classifications_english.txt respectively. To cache
the flattened images in text again run Training_English_Dataset.py
